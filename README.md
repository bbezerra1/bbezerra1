Hi, Iâ€™m Bruno Bezerra, i'm currently studying biological sciences in the University of Sao Paulo.
I spend two years of my graduation working with molecular evolution, and using bioinformatics to do it (the paper i published: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95094-4).
Some of the scripts here presented i developed by my own to just save some time of some pipelines that i used to work with.

Now i'm studying mySQL and the R language, looking for improve myself with bioinformatics. Also, i'm REALLY interested in a opportunity to work or research, so if you have seen
my scripts and need an undergrad student with my skills, please contact me in my email: bruno.s.bez@gmail.com
